Instead, this terrestrial organic carbon is trapped in river dams. While this may indicate that there is no overall change in the burial of carbon, the decrease in the flux of sediment to the delta promotes delta erosion (increase of 0.34 Mt OC/yr), re-exposing carbon to be remineralized and degraded. In fact, the delta transformed from a preferential site of carbon burial (3.46 Mt OC/yr) prior to the river damming to a site of carbon erosion (-0.41 Mt/yr) after the construction of the river dam.\"",
